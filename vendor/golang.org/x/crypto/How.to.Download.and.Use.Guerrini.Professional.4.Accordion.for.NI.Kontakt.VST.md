## Step 3: Adjust the Settings and Play the Accordion
  
Now you are ready to play the accordion. You can use your MIDI keyboard or controller to trigger the notes and switches. You can also use your mouse to click on the buttons and knobs on the screen. Here are some of the settings and features you can adjust:
  
- The "Register" section allows you to select which register you want to play on the right hand. You can choose from 11 different registers, each with a different sound and timbre. You can also switch between them using keyswitches on your keyboard (from C0 to B0).
- The "Bass" section allows you to select which register you want to play on the left hand. You can choose from one bass register called "Organtone Bass", which has 120 buttons. You can also switch it on or off using a keyswitch on your keyboard (C1).
- The "Variation" section allows you to add some randomization and humanization to your playing. You can choose from four variations for the right hand (X4) and two variations for the left hand (X2). These variations will slightly alter the pitch, volume and timing of each note, making it sound more natural and expressive.
- The "Dynamic" section allows you to control how loud or soft you want to play. You can choose from three dynamic levels for the right hand (Gently, Normal or Sharp) and adjust the volume slider for each level. You can also switch between them using keyswitches on your keyboard (from C#1 to D#1).
- The "Effect" section allows you to add some reverb, echo and attack time to your sound. You can adjust the amount and type of reverb and echo using the knobs and buttons on the screen. You can also adjust how fast or slow each note starts using the attack time slider.
- The "Bellow" section allows you to control how much air pressure you want to apply to the bellow of the accordion. You can adjust the bellow slider using your mouse or use an expression pedal connected to your MIDI controller. The bellow slider will affect how loud or soft each note sounds, as well as how much vibrato or tone effect is applied.
- The "Vibrato" section allows you to add some vibrato or bellow shake effect to your sound. You can adjust the speed and depth of vibrato using the knobs on the screen. You can also switch it on or off using a keyswitch on your keyboard (E1).
