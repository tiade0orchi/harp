LADSIM 64 bit includes a visual editing environment for graphical programming. You can use a simple 'drag and drop' method to add functions to the ladder rung, and add comments to each rung for documentation purposes. LADSIM 64 bit supports various functions, such as inputs, outputs, timers, counters, flags and shift registers. You can also use an interactive debugger to test your program before using it to control a specific application.
 
LADSIM 64 bit comes with eight internal simulations that are designed to aid and test your knowledge of ladder logic programming. These simulations are: Annunciator, Traffic Light, Car Park, Elevator, Drinks Machine, Packing Line, Bottling Plant, and the ICT3. Each simulation mimics a real-world scenario that can be controlled by your ladder logic program. You can also connect LADSIM 64 bit to external devices, such as the ICT3 trainer kit, through a suitable interface card and control them through the real I/O.
 
LADSIM 64 bit is a great tool for learning and teaching PLC programming and ladder logic. It is suitable for further and higher education students who want to learn process engineering and process control using PLC methods. It is also ideal for professionals who want to refresh their skills or develop new programs for their applications. LADSIM 64 bit is available from Bytronic, a leading provider of educational technology products. You can download a free demo version of LADSIM 64 bit from their website[^1^] or contact them for more information.
